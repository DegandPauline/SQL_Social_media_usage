1. Group students by age ranges (e.g., 18â€“20, 21â€“24) and compute the average mental health score per group.

2. Create a custom risk score: Addiction + Conflicts â€“ Sleep Hours, and show the top 10 highest-risk students.

3. Rank students based on their addiction score using a window function (RANK()).

4. Analyze whether higher daily usage correlates with lower mental health scores (e.g., grouped by usage brackets).

5. Calculate the percentage of students whose academic performance is affected, broken down by age group.
